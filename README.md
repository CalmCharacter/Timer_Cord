An extension cord electronic device that help prevent home appliances from catching fire due to unattended electrical appliances and devices such as flat irons, rice cooker, overcharged mobile devices and etc.
the extension cord employs a timer that can be set manually to regulate power supply over a set period. An alarm will sound when a timer runs out of time and then the electronic device shuts the power to the appliances, and no electricity can flow through it.
With that, the user or clients may securely leave the appliance/devices and focus onother important tasks while connecting an appliances/device to the extension cord.

This project can also be improved with the implemention of IOT (internet of things) such as the ability control extension timer cord via mobile application.
